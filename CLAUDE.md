# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this
repository.

## Project Overview

Apollonia is a Python 3.13+ microservices architecture for file monitoring and processing, using
AMQP message queuing for service communication. While the project targets Python 3.13 as its primary
version, CI/CD tests maintain compatibility with Python 3.12. The project consists of two main
services:

1. **Ingestor**: Monitors the `/data` directory for new files and publishes file metadata to AMQP
1. **Populator**: Consumes messages from AMQP queue (appears designed for Neo4j import based on
   dependencies)

## Development Commands

### Setup and Installation

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install development dependencies
uv sync --all-extras

# Install pre-commit hooks
uv run task install-hooks
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code with Ruff
uv run task format

# Run linting checks
uv run task lint

# Run type checking
uv run task typecheck

# Run all quality checks
uv run task check

# Run pre-commit on all files
uv run task check-all
```

### Docker Operations

```bash
# Build all services with docker-compose
uv run task build-docker

# Start all services (RabbitMQ, Neo4j, Ingestor, Populator)
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Build individual services
docker build -t apollonia-ingestor ./ingestor
docker build -t apollonia-populator ./populator
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
uv run task test

# Run tests in watch mode
uv run task test-watch

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_ingestor.py -v

# Run tests for a specific Python version
uv run --python 3.12 pytest
```

### Development Tasks

```bash
# Run the ingestor locally
uv run task ingestor

# Run the populator locally
uv run task populator

# Clean build artifacts
uv run task clean

# Build Python packages
uv run task build

# Update pre-commit hooks
uv run task update-hooks
```

## Required Environment Variables

### Ingestor

- `AMQP_CONNECTION_STRING`: AMQP broker URL (default: `amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/`)
- `DATA_DIRECTORY`: Directory to monitor for files (default: `/data`)

### Populator

- `AMQP_CONNECTION_STRING`: AMQP broker URL (default: `amqp://guest:guest@localhost:5672/`)
- `NEO4J_URI`: Neo4j connection URI (default: `bolt://localhost:7687`)
- `NEO4J_USER`: Neo4j username (default: `neo4j`)
- `NEO4J_PASSWORD`: Neo4j password (required, no default)

## Architecture

### Service Communication

- Services communicate via AMQP using a fan-out exchange named "apollonia"
- Messages are JSON-encoded file metadata with persistent delivery mode
- The ingestor publishes to the exchange, populator consumes from its queue

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Asynchronous Processing**: Both services use async/await patterns
1. **Event-Driven Architecture**: File system events trigger the processing pipeline
1. **Context Manager Pattern**: Clean resource management (see Ingestor class)
1. **Microservices**: Loosely coupled services with message queue communication

### Message Format

The ingestor publishes messages with this structure:

```json
{
  "file_path": "/data/example.txt",
  "event_type": "IN_CREATE",
  "sha256_hash": "...",
  "xxh128_hash": "...",
  "modified_time": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000000",
  "accessed_time": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000000",
  "changed_time": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000000",
  "neighbors": ["example.txt.meta", "example.txt.bak"]
}
```

### Service-Specific Notes

#### Ingestor (`/ingestor/`)

- Uses `asyncinotify` for file system monitoring
- Implements file "prospecting" to find related files (neighbors)
- Computes both SHA256 and xxh128 hashes for files
- Handles inotify events: IN_CREATE, IN_MOVED_TO

#### Populator (`/populator/`)

- Basic structure exists but core functionality needs implementation
- Configured for Neo4j integration (see dependencies)
- Should implement message consumption and Neo4j import logic

## Important Implementation Details

1. **File Watching**: The ingestor monitors `/data` directory inside the container
1. **Error Handling**: Both services implement graceful shutdown on SIGINT/SIGTERM
1. **Message Persistence**: AMQP messages use delivery_mode=2 for persistence
1. **Non-Root Execution**: Docker containers run as non-root user (UID 1001)
1. **Multi-Platform Support**: CI builds for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64

## Current Development State

- **Ingestor service**: Complete with async file monitoring, hashing, and AMQP publishing
- **Populator service**: Complete with AMQP consumption and Neo4j graph import
- **Development tooling**: Modern Python setup with uv, ruff, mypy, and taskipy
- **Docker**: Multi-stage builds with OCI-compliant labels and health checks
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with Python testing, security scanning, and multi-platform builds
- **Testing**: Framework is set up, tests need to be implemented

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Development**:

   ```bash
   # Start dependencies
   docker-compose up -d rabbitmq neo4j

   # Run services locally
   uv run task ingestor  # In one terminal
   uv run task populator # In another terminal
   ```

1. **Before Committing**:

   ```bash
   uv run task check-all  # Run all quality checks
   ```

1. **Testing Changes**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   docker-compose up
   # Copy test files to ./data directory
   ```
